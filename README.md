# Rabi Oscillations in a bononic 17 state system
An interactive Notebook for calcualating the time evolution of the Zeemann sublevel population in bosonic Dysprosium 164. 

## Motivation

We consider a two state system in a magnetic field, parallel to the $z$ direction. We superimpose an oscillating radio frequency (RF) field from the $x$ direction. In a rotating frame and taking into account the rotating wave approximation (RWA), we obtain the following Hamiltonian: 

$$ H = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
\delta & \Omega \\
\Omega & \delta  
\end{bmatrix}  $$

If the RF frequncy approaches the energetic transition frequency, we get a periodic population of the two energy levels. 

## What does it do?
This notebook generalizes this behaviour to a multi state system with equal energetic splittings. 

The tool lets you 
- Plot the population probability of all 17 zeeman sublevels 
- Vary the RF field strength in real time 
- Vary the detuning from the resonance frequency in real time
